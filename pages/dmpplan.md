### DSCI/LIB 350, Fall 2025

*Team Members: Daniel Johnson, Ava Nepple, Ashna Rajbhandari, Adaleah Carman* 

**Vietnam War Protests on College Campuses**

Our digital collection thematic research topic focusses on protest movements on US college campuses during the Vietnam war. This collection spans from 1965 to 1972 and depicts many aspects of protests during this very controversial time in American history. Containing images of student protests, speakers, signs, and posters, this collection provides insight into the role of young people in nationwide events and what they did to get their voices heard.

**Data Curation Methodology**

Our data collection primarily came from GLAMS, including the oregon digital repository, UCLA Library Digital Collections, San Jose State University, Special Collections and Archives, and the University of British Columbia Library. In order to collected at least 20 objects, all four of us each collected a minimum of 5 objects to catalog into our collection, all working out of different GLAMS. We first dealt with catalogging data on a Google Sheet, which we then cleaned and uploaded to collection builder.


**Expected Data**

**Data Types**: There are 20 items in this digital collection, with each file being either of the .jpg or .jpeg file types, to ensure we did no exceed size limitations. 

**Data Handling**

The digital objects have been collected by Daniel Johnson, Ava Nepple, Adaleah Carman, and Ashna Rajbhandari from multiple publicly accessible online repositories. The objects collected have copyright and licensing that allows for educational use and redistribution. The items have been cataloged according to a file naming convention which will be explained below in  an accessible document at the bottom of this paragraph. Our Metadata Application Profile is also linked underneath this section. All the data employed in our collection is available through our group Sharepoint and Google Drive which contains both the raw and converted files as well as our metadata spreadsheet. The objects have been cited and can be traced back to their original repositories if viewers wish to engage with material further and delve into other collections and repositories.
