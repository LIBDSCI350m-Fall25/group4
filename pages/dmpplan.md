## Group 4  

### DSCI/LIB 350, Fall 2025

*Team Members: Daniel Johnson, Ava Nepple, Ashna Rajbhandari, Adaleah Carman* 

**Vietnam War Protests on College Campuses**

Our digital collection thematic research topic focusses on protest movements on US college campuses during the Vietnam war. This collection spans from 1965 to 1972 and depicts many aspects of protests during this very controversial time in American history. Containing images of student protests, speakers, signs, and posters, this collection provides insight into the role of young people in nationwide events and what they did to get their voices heard.

**Data Curation Methodology**

Our data collection primarily came from GLAMS, including the oregon digital repository, UCLA Library Digital Collections, San Jose State University, Special Collections and Archives, and the University of British Columbia Library. In order to collected at least 20 objects, all four of us each collected a minimum of 5 objects to catalog into our collection, all working out of different GLAMS. We first dealt with catalogging data on a Google Sheet, which we then cleaned and uploaded to collection builder.

**Roles & Responsibilities**: 

**Michell Martinez**, *Project Manager*: Primarily responsible for keeping things organized and on track. She oversaw the project as a whole. This person is going to be the lead communicator with oversight outside of the team and checking in with individual members making sure the team is working cohesively. Michell has been the one to schedule meetings, speak with instructors outside of class, get clarifying information, and help out in multiple areas of the project. If Michell were to leave this project her duties would be delegated amongst the rest of the members in the group until another person was brought on. The CDM would take on the responsibilities of communication and meeting organization. The OPM and MM would split the management responsibilities of project tasks and due dates.  

**Riley Bair**, *Collection Development Manager*: Riley is in charge of making decisions based on what items to include in the collection, working with the OPM to make decisions on file formats, ensures proper documentation of copyright statements and licensing, responsible for the narrative of the collection and the story being told within the data, makes everything cohesive. If Riley were to leave the project her data collection role would be split between the MM and the OPM and the storytelling aspect would be allocated to the PM. 

**Kaitlin McKay**, *Object Preservation Manager*: Kaitlin played a major role in overseeing the organization and management of the project's data storage and document structures, leading digital file reformatting, leading file naming standards and preservation formats, and working with CollectionBuilder's file format requirements.This position involves ensuring the efficient management of digital data, maintaining data quality, and adhering to preservation standards. If Kaitlin were to leave the project her role would be split between the CDM and the MM. 

**Amanda Hellenkamp**, *Metadata Manager*: Amanda’s role is responsible for heading the implementation of the MAP while cataloging our  
objects. She oversees the spreadsheets we use to catalog and make sure everyone's data is following the standards laid out in our MAP. This role involves organization and high attention to detail. If Amanda were to leave the project her role would be split across every role until her position was filled. It would end up falling mostly on the Project and Repository Manager to do the end bits of detail checking while uploading the data into our repository.  

**Expected Data**

**Data Types**: There are 26 items in this digital collection. 12 text documents (.pdf), 13 images (.jpeg), and 1 youtube video linked. The total size of the collection’s data is 100.4 MB as of March 2024  

| Work Type | File Format | Total Assets | Average File Size | Total Size of All Files |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Image        | .jpeg       | 13           | 0.25 MB           | 3.3 MB               |
| Document     | .pdf        | 12           | 8.09 MB           | 97.1 MB              |
| Youtube Vid  | N/A         | 1            | N/A               | N/A                  |

**Data Handling**

The digital objects have been collected by Riley Bair, Michell Martinez, Kaitlin McKay, and Amanda Hellenkamp from multiple publicly accessible online repositories. The objects collected have copyright and licensing that allows for educational use and redistribution. The items have been cataloged according to a file naming convention which will be explained below in text and an accessible document at the bottom of this page. All the data employed in our collection is available through our group Sharepoint and Google Drive which contains both the raw and converted files as well as our metadata spreadsheet. The objects have been cited and can be traced back to their original repositories if viewers wish to engage with material further and delve into other collections and repositories.   

**File Naming Convention**: All file names must adhere to this naming convention to ensure ease of access and organization amongst data
**Convention**: histoftrktwn_year_titleofobject_itemnumber.extension  
**File Naming Convention Defined**:  
**histoftrktwn**: history of track town  year: year it was made  
**titleofobject**: very short keywords: 4 characters  
*Bill Bowerman*= BBOW, *Prefontaine*= PFON, *Hayward Field*= HWYF, *Emerald*= DEMD
*Bill hayward*= BHAY, *Phil Knight*= PKNI, *Olympic Track Meet* = OTRK,  
**Number**: Three-digit number starting with 001 for every image. If more than one image with a similar filename exists, apply a numerically ordered sequence   
**File Naming Convention in Practice**: histotrktwn_1947_demd_015.pdf  

**Legal & Ethical Restrictions**: We do not see any legal or ethical reasons impacting the accessibility of our repository. All the items chosen have been granted access for educational use and redistribution following the proper citation. Nearly all of the objects being employed within our collection currently have been accessed through other various public repositories and collections. There is no data that is at risk of being privatized in this collection.  

**Aggregated & Shared Data**: All digital objects included in this collection will be available to download through Collection Builder website which is linked at the bottom of this page. All information regarding rights and creative commons will be included under the objects metadata on the items page within Collection Builder. 

**Period of Data Retention**: All data collected will be displayed on our Collection Builder site and will be accessible at all times. 

**Data Formats and Dissemination**:This collection has been compiled with the intention of educational and recreational knowledge use. We expect a wide range of users to be accessing our database. For this reason we’ve chosen to use JPEG and PDF files for users to access the objects. The decision to use these file formats is due to the compatibility across various computer operating systems, ensuring broad accessibility to the public. Our metadata is stored in a computer readable CSV file within our github that allows the information to be displayed alongside our objects. All copyright and creative commons information will be available through the metadata provided alongside each object. The rights statements describe the accessibility of each object and how they’re legally allowed to be used. Any questions regarding the legality and security restriction of the objects shared through our collection will be accessible through our metadata. Our collection is for educational purposes and created with no intention of monetary gain. 

**Data Storage and Preservation of Access**: The data included in this collection will be stored in the github repository and available through the Collection Builder website. Individual copies and backups of the data will be stored within our teams Sharepoint and Google Drive which require special access. These data sites would be available to anyone who chose to enter the team or wanted to continue the project after Michell Martinez, Riley Bair, Kaitlin McKay, and Amanda Hellenkamp deem their collection complete.
