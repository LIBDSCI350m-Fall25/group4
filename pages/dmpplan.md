## Group 4  

### DSCI/LIB 350, Fall 2025

*Team Members: Daniel Johnson, Ava Nepple, Ashna Rajbhandari, Adaleah Carman* 

**Vietnam War Protests on College Campuses**

Our digital collection thematic research topic focusses on protest movements on US college campuses during the Vietnam war. This collection spans from 1965 to 1972 and depicts many aspects of protests during this very controversial time in American history. Containing images of student protests, speakers, signs, and posters, this collection provides insight into the role of young people in nationwide events and what they did to get their voices heard.

**Data Curation Methodology**

Our data collection primarily came from GLAMS, including the oregon digital repository, UCLA Library Digital Collections, San Jose State University, Special Collections and Archives, and the University of British Columbia Library. In order to collected at least 20 objects, all four of us each collected a minimum of 5 objects to catalog into our collection, all working out of different GLAMS. We first dealt with catalogging data on a Google Sheet, which we then cleaned and uploaded to collection builder.

**Roles & Responsibilities**: 

**Ashna Rajbhandari**, *Project Manager*: As Project Manager, Ashna oversaw all project activities and ensured clear communication within the team and with the course instructor. She led the development of major deliverables,including the progress report, data management plan, documentation, and final presentation, and coordinated quality reviews. Ashna was also responsible for organizing the shared workspace, submitting assignments, and ensuring that meeting notes were properly documented and stored.

**Adaleah Carman**, *Collection Development Manager*: As Collection Development Manager, Adaleah approved the 20–30 objects that made up the digital collection. She led research on the topic and defined the scope while ensuring all copyright and licensing information was accurately recorded. She also collaborated with the preservation team to confirm that selected files met format and quality standards.

**Daniel Johnson**, *Object Preservation Manager*: As Object Preservation Manager, Danny oversaw the organization of the project’s files and ensured that digital objects were stored, named, and formatted according to preservation best practices. He managed the Google Drive folder structure, coordinated how objects were added, and ensured that backups existed for all materials. Danny also set file requirements for the collection and decided which objects met the technical standards needed for CollectionBuilder.

**Ava Nepple**, *Metadata Manager*: As Metadata Manager, Ava led the cataloging of all objects and ensured that metadata followed Dublin Core, CollectionBuilder, and any group-specific standards. She maintained the master metadata spreadsheet and standardized data entry for consistency and accuracy across the collection. Ava also performed metadata quality reviews and made final decisions about how each object was described.

**Expected Data**

**Data Types**: There are 20 items in this digital collection, with each file being either of the .jpg or .jpeg file types, to ensure we did no exceed size limitations. 

**Data Handling**

The digital objects have been collected by Daniel Johnson, Ava Nepple, Adaleah Carman, and Ashna Rajbhandari from multiple publicly accessible online repositories. The objects collected have copyright and licensing that allows for educational use and redistribution. The items have been cataloged according to a file naming convention which will be explained below in  an accessible document at the bottom of this paragraph. Our Metadata Application Profile is also linked underneath this section. All the data employed in our collection is available through our group Sharepoint and Google Drive which contains both the raw and converted files as well as our metadata spreadsheet. The objects have been cited and can be traced back to their original repositories if viewers wish to engage with material further and delve into other collections and repositories.
